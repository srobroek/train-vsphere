# Maintainers

This file lists how the Train-Habitat project is maintained.
When making changes to the system, this file tells you who needs to review your
patch - you need at least one maintainer to provide a :+1: on your pull
request. Additionally, you need to not receive a veto from a Lieutenant or the
Project Lead.  Check out [How Chef is
Maintained](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc030-maintenance-policy.md#how-the-project-is-maintained)
for details on the process, how to become a maintainer, lieutenant, or the
project lead.
